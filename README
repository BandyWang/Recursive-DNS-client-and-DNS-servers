0. Please write down the full names and netids of both your team members.
    Bandy Wang (bw307) and WeiJi Zheng (wz232)

1. Briefly discuss how you implemented your recursive client functionality.
    I first establish the RS and TS servers. From the client, for each query from PROJI-HNS.txt, the program will first
    send the query to the RS server. If the query is found in the RS server, the RS server will reply back with the
    query's ip address and the client will write in RESOLVED.txt. Otherwise if not found in the RS server, the RS server
    will reply to the client the ip address of the TS server. The client will then esablish a connection with the TS
    server and send the query there. The TS server will reply back with withever the query is found in it's server and
    the result is written in RESOLVED.txt.
